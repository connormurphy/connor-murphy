A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds

of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

  
In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich instarch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brownwhen ripe.
