    items:
    - title: Creative Approach
      body: I try to learn as much as I can before designing. This means really understanding
        the problem at hand through research and anything else I can do to connect
        to the project or client.
    - title: Design Strategy
      body: I pull together a few design directions, create prototypes, and really
        get a feel for the product before going into development.
    - title: Production & Implementation
      body: I collaborate with developers to implement the final project. This means
        running through quality assurance and testing to make sure we have the best
        possible solution.

  title: About
  body: I’m currently working with the fine folks @ [Shopify](https://shopify.com){:target=“_blank”}{:rel=“noopener
    noreferrer”}, but have limited availibility for freelance. When I’m not designing,
    you can catch me outside exploring, hiking Colorado’s famous peaks, searching
    for the best Hefeweizens, or complaining about Denver’s pizza. That’s what being
    born and raised in New York will do to you.
  secondary: Didn’t expect Myspace to be a career-launcher, but that’s how I got my
    start in design. As a mostly self-taught designer, I’ve worked for startups, agencies,
    and even solo. These days I’m based in Denver—but I'm a big remote work advocate.
