  headline: I’m Connor, $br a digital designer based in Denver &#9968;
  about:
    body: I’m currently working with the fine folks @ [Shopify](https://shopify.com){:target=“_blank”}{:rel=“noopener
      noreferrer”}, but have limited availibility for freelance. When I’m not designing,
      you can catch me outside exploring, hiking Colorado’s famous peaks, searching
      for the best Hefeweizens, or complaining about Denver’s pizza. That’s what being
      born and raised in New York will do to you.

    title: Process
    items:
    - title: Creative Approach
      body: I try to learn as much as I can before designing. This means really understanding
        the problem at hand through research and anything else I can do to connect
        to the project or client.
    - title: Design Strategy
      body: I pull together a few design directions, create prototypes, and really
        get a feel for the product before going into development.
    - title: Production & Implementation
      body: I collaborate with developers to implement the final project. This means
        running through quality assurance and testing to make sure we have the best
        possible solution.

  title: About
  body: Didn’t expect Myspace to be a career-launcher, but that’s how I got my start
    in design. As a mostly self-taught designer, I’ve worked for startups, agencies,
    and even solo. These days I’m based in Denver—but I'm a big remote work advocate.
  secondary: I’ve had the pleasure of working with companies like InVision, Shopify,
    AT&T, RingCentral, and more. I have limited availability for freelance, but if
    you are working on something cool and think I can help feel free to [email me](mailto:me@connormurphy.design).
